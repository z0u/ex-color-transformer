    "This is an experiment to squash higher-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional embedding space. We'll start with color: RGB values (3 dimensions) ranging from 0..1. If we compress them into a 2D embedding, we should expect to see superposition, with directions interpretable as they would be in a classic color wheel: three primary color directions (RGB) spaced 120° apart.\n"

    "While we describe colors in terms of hue (the color wheel), saturation (color intensity), and value (brightness), RGB values combine these properties in a non-intuitive way. Since we aim to test whether hues naturally embed as a color wheel, our training data should use a color space that has hue as an axis — that way, we can create a train/test split that excludes certain hues. See the notebook [Training data: color](ex-color-data.ipynb) for an exploration of color cubes in this context.\n"

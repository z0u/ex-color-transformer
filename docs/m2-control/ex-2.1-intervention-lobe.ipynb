    "# Experiment 2.1: Intervention lobes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this series of experiments, we shall explore the effects of intervening on latent activations. Having structured the latent space (see Ex 1.x), it should just be a matter of transforming latent embeddings that are closely aligned to the anchored concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We draw inspiration from shaders in computer graphics: BSDFs compute the output energy given: 1. an input light direction, and 2. the viewing direction, relative to the surface normal. Our interventions are similar: we have 1. a subject concept vector, and 2. activation vectors. If we treat the subject vector as analogous to a light source and acivation vectors as analogous to viewing directions, we may build on a wealth of established techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we define our intervention as a BSDF-like function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e' = f(s,e)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $e$ is an embedding vector, $s$ is the subject, and $e'$ is the modified embedding. In fact $s$ need not be a (directional) vector; it could be other geometric features of our embedding space, such as a subspace defined by multiple basis vectors."

    "# Experiment 2.2: Specific concept intervention\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [1.x series](/README.md#m1-preliminary-experiments-with-color) of experiments (milestone 1), we validated our ideas for imposing structure on latent space. With only weak supervision, we guided a simple RGB autoencoder to use the color wheel for its latent representations. In this series, we'll try to inhibit and even delete certain concepts from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, let's take one of the earlier experiments and see what happens when we suppress activations that align with _red_.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "We've structured the latent space so red is located at $[1,0,0,0]$. If we suppress or redirect activations close to that vector, model performance on near-red colors should drop, while other colors remain mostly unaffected."
